The entire network is being represented on the left, and you can unfold the network explicitly to see how it behaves at any given `t`.\n",

Pay special attention to the $c_t$ parameters and how they pass through the unit to get an intuition for how this problem is solved.\n",

        "So why are these cool?

There is widespread concern about the possible escape of ISIS prisoners held by Kurdish forces, and on Sunday, it was reported that at least 750 people suspected of affiliation with ISIS fled a secure displacement camp in the chaos caused by Turkish shelling. In addition, several dozen “high-value” ISIS prisoners were reportedly left behind by U.S. troops when they retreated, the New York Times reported, and ISIS has already claimed at least two attacks in the area since the invasion started, including a car bombing that killed three people.'"
